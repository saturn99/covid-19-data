<p>We make our full testing dataset, alongside detailed source descriptions, available&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/">on GitHub here</a>. Our testing dataset is updated around twice a week.</p>

<h3>About the dataset</h3>
<p>Our goal at <em>Our World in Data</em> is to provide testing data over time for many countries around the world.</p>
<p>To do this, we collect publicly available information published by official sources on a regular basis. Our dataset is updated around twice a week.</p>
<p>Alongside the data, we also aim to provide a good understanding of the definitions used and any important limitations they might have. Our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data">checklist of questions</a> about testing data is what guides our efforts.</p>
<p>We present this information in source descriptions for each country included in the dataset. But in many cases sources do not yet provide the detailed descriptions of the data we would like.</p>
<h3>Which countries do we have testing data for?</h3>
<p>In this map countries for which testing data can be found in our dataset are shown in blue.</p>
<p>As you can see, we do not have data for all countries in our dataset. Those countries where we have looked, but have not been able to find any official sources of testing data are shown in red. Countries which we are either in the process of adding to our dataset, or for which we have not yet been able to look for data are shown in grey.</p>

<h4>How up to date is our data for different countries?</h4>
<p>Countries publish their testing data at different frequencies: some provide daily updates, others only weekly, and some only publish figures on an ad-hoc basis at longer intervals.</p>
<p>Because of this, the most recent data we have for different countries refers to different dates. This chart shows you how up to date the latest data is for each country in our dataset.</p>
<p>Our dataset covers <strong>{world_population_covered_anytime}%</strong> of the world's population:</p>
<ul><li><strong>{world_population_covered_1d}%</strong> is covered with figures relating to <strong>{date_1d}</strong> or later;</li>
<li><strong>{world_population_covered_7d}%</strong> is covered with figures relating to <strong>{date_7d}</strong> or later.</li>
</ul>
